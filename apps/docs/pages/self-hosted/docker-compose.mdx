# Docker Compose

This document provides a guide for deploying PenX with Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Create docker-compose.yml

To deploy PenX with docker compose, create a docker-compose.yml file:

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  penx-self-hosted:
    image: 0xzion/penx:latest
    container_name: penx-self-hosted
    environment:
      - NEXTAUTH_SECRET={{jwt_secret}}
      - DATABASE_URL={{postgresql_database_url}}
      - REDIS_URL={{redis_url}}
      - SELF_HOSTED_CREDENTIALS=penx/123456 # username and password
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
```

The environment variables used by PenX are described in [environment-variables](/self-hosted/deployment-env).

## Start the containers

Now, execute `docker-compose up -d` to start PenX service.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Upgrading

When a new version of PenX is released, the application can be upgraded with the following commands, run in the directory with the docker-compose.yml file:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```
