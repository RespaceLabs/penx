# Create First Extension

This a guide to build a minimal extension and debug in PenX.

## Prerequisites

Before write the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites.

- you have [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed.
- You have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
- You are familiar Javascript or TypeScript.

## Clone the sample extension

Clone the sample plugin using Git.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:penxio/penx-extension-sample.git
```

## Develop your extension

After clone it, you'll compile the sample extension

```bash
cd penx-extension-sample
npm install # install the dependencies
npm run dev # compile the source code
```

When you `npm run dev`, PenX will load the sample extension automatically.

The source code of `Hello world` is very simple:

```ts
// src/index.ts
import { renderMarkdown } from 'penx'

renderMarkdown('# hello world!')
```

## Test it in PenX

Open Penx and run the `Hello world` command:

![hello-world-sample](/images/hello-world-sample.png)

🎉 Congratulations! You built your first extension successfully.
